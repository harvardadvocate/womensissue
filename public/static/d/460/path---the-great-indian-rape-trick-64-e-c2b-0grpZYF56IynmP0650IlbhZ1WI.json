{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>At the premiere screening of Bandit Queen in Delhi, Shekhar Kapur introduced the film with\nthese words: \"I had a choice between Truth and Aesthetics. I chose Truth, because Truth is Pure.\"\nTo insist that the film tells the Truth is of the utmost commercial (and critical) importance to him. Again and again, we are assured, in interviews, in reviews, and eventually in writing on the screen before the film begins. \"This is a True Story.\"</p>\n<p>If it weren't the \"Truth\", what would redeem it from being just a classy version of your\nrun-of-the-mill Rape n' Retribution theme that our film industry churns out every now and then?\nWhat would save it from the familiar accusation that it doesn't show India in a Proper Light?\nExactly Nothing.</p>\n<p>It's the \"Truth\" that saves it. Every time. It dives about like Superman with a swiss knife - and\nsnatches the film straight from the jaws of unsavoury ignominy. It has bought headlines. Blunted\nargument. Drowned criticism.</p>\n<p>If you say you found the film distasteful, you're told - Well that's what truth is - distasteful.\nManipulative? That's Life - manipulative.</p>\n<p>Go on. Now you try.</p>\n<p>Try...Exploitative. Or.. Gross. Try Gross.</p>\n<p>It's a little like having a dialogue with the backs of trucks.</p>\n<p>God is Love.</p>\n<p>Life is Hard.</p>\n<p>Truth is Pure.</p>\n<p>Sound Horn.</p>\n<p>Whether or not it is the Truth is no longer relevant. The point is that it will, ( if it hasn't\nalready) - become the Truth.</p>\n<p>Phoolan Devi the woman has ceased to be important. (Yes of course she exists. She has\neyes, ears, limbs hair etc. Even an address now) But she is suffering from a case of Legenditis.\nShe's only a version of herself. There are other versions of her that are jostling for attention.\nParticularly Shekhar Kapur's \"Truthful\" one, which we are currently being bludgeoned into\nbelieving.</p>\n<p>\"... it has the kind of story, which, if it were a piece of fiction, would be difficult to credit. In\nfact, it is the true story of Phoolan Devi, the Indian child bride...\"</p>\n<p>Derek Malcolm writes in The Guardian.</p>\n<p>But is it? The True Story? How does one decide? Who decides?</p>\n<p>Shekhar Kapur says that the film is based on Mala Sen's book - India's Bandit Queen: The\nTrue Story of Phoolan Devi. The book reconstructs the story, using interviews, newspaper\nreports, meetings with Phoolan Devi and extracts from Phoolan's written account, smuggled out\nof prison by her visitors, a few pages at a time.</p>\n<p>Sometimes various versions of the same event - versions that totally conflict with each other\ni.e: Phoolan's version, a journalist's version, or an eye- witnesses version - are all presented to\nthe reader in the book. What emerges is a complex, intelligent and human book. Full of\nambiguity, full of concern, full curiosity about who this woman called Phoolan Devi really is.\nShekhar Kapur wasn't curious.</p>\n<p>He has openly admitted that he didn't feel that he needed to meet Phoolan. His producer\nBobby Bedi supports this decision \"Shekhar would have met her if he had felt a need to do so.\"\n(Sunday Observer August 20th [1994]).</p>\n<p>It didn't matter to Shekhar Kapur who Phoolan Devi really was. What kind of person she\nwas. She was a woman, wasn't she? She was raped wasn't she? So what did that make her? A\nRaped Woman! You've seen one, you've seen 'em all.</p>\n<p>He was in business.</p>\n<p>What the hell would he need to meet her for?</p>\n<p>Did he not stop to think that there must have been something very special about her? That if\nthis was the normal career graph if a low-caste village woman that was raped, our landscapes\nwould be teeming with female gangsters?</p>\n<p>If there is another biographer any where in the world who has not done a living subject the\ncourtesy of meeting her even once - will you please stand up and say your name? And having\ndone that, will you (and your work) kindly take a running jump?</p>\n<p>What does Shekhar Kapur mean when he says the film is based on Mala Sen's book? How\nhas he decided which version of which event is \"True\" ? On what basis has he made these\nchoices?</p>\n<p>There's a sort of loutish arrogance at work here. A dunce's courage. Unafraid of what it\ndoesn't know.</p>\n<p>What he has done is to rampage through the book picking up what suits him, ignoring and\neven altering what doesn't.</p>\n<p>I am not suggesting that a film should include every fact that's in the book.\nI am suggesting that if you take a long hard look at the choices he has made - at his\ninclusions, his omissions and his blatant alterations, a truly dreadful pattern emerges.\nPhoolan Devi (in the film version), has been kept on a tight leash. Each time she strays\ntowards the shadowy marshlands that lie between Victimhood and Brutishness, she has been\nreined in. Brought to heel.</p>\n<p>It is of consummate importance to the Emotional Graph of the film, that you never, ever, stop\npitying her. That she never threatens the Power Balance.</p>\n<p>I would have thought that this was anathema to the whole point of the Phoolan Devi story.\nThat it went way beyond the You-Rape-Me: I'll-Kill- You equation. That the whole point of it was\nthat she got a little out of control. That the Brutalized became the Brute.</p>\n<p>The film wants no part of this. Because of what it would do to the Emotional Graph. To\nunderstand this, you must try and put Rape into its correct perspective. The Rape of a nice\nWoman (saucy, headstrong, foul-mouthed perhaps, but basicaly moral, sexually moral) - is one\nthing. The rape of a nasty/perceived-to-be-immoral womall, is quite another. It wouldn't be quite\nso bad. You wouldn't feel quite so sorry. Perhaps you wouldn't feel sorry at all.</p>\n<p>Any policeman will tell you that.</p>\n<p>Whenever the police are accused of custodial rape, they immediately set to work. Not to\nprove that she wasn't raped. But to prove that she wasn't nice. To prove that she was a loose\nwoman A prostitute. A divorcee. Or an Elopee - ie: She asked for it.</p>\n<p>Same difference.</p>\n<p>Bandit Queen -the film, does not make a case against Rape. It makes its case against the\nRape of nice (read moral), women. (Never mind the rest of us that aren't \"nice\") .</p>\n<p>[??The film is consistently??] it's on the lookout, like a worried hen - saving Phoolan Devi\nfrom herself. Meanwhile we, the audience, are herded along, like so much trusting cattle. We\ncannot argue, (because Truth is Pure. And you can't mess With that).</p>\n<p>Every time the Director has been faced with something that could disrupt the simple, pre-\nfabricated calculations uf his cloying morality play, it has been tampered with and forced to fit.\nI'm not accusing him of having planned this.</p>\n<p>I believe that it comes from a vision that has been distorted by his own middle-class outrage,\nwhich he has then turned on his audience like a fire-fighter's hose.</p>\n<p>According to Shekhar Kapur's film, every landmark - every decison, every turning-point in\nPhoolan Devi's life, starting with how she became a dacoit in the first place, has to do with\nhaving been raped, or avenging rape.</p>\n<p>He has just blundered through her life like a Rape-diviner</p>\n<p>You cannot but sense his horrified fascination at the havoc that a wee willie can wreak. It's a\nsort of reversed male self absorption.</p>\n<p>Rape is the main dish. Caste is the sauce that it swims in.</p>\n<p>The film opens with a pre-credit sequence of Phoolan Devi the child being married off to an\nolder man who takes her away to his village where he rapes her, and she eventually runs away.\nWe see her next as a young girl being sexually abused bv Thakur louts in her village . When\nshe protests, she is publicly humiliated, externed from the village, and when she returns to the\nvillage, ends up in prison. Here too she is raped and beaten, and eventually released on bail.\nSoon after her release, she is carried away bv dacoits. She has in effect become a criminal who\nhas jumped bail. And so has little choice but to embark on a life in the ravines.</p>\n<p>He has the caste-business and the rape-business neatly intertwined to kick-start that \"swift,\ndense, dramatic narrative\" (Sunil Sethi, Pioneer August 14th [1994])</p>\n<p>Mala's book tells a different story.</p>\n<p>Phoolan Devi stages her first protest against injustice at the age of ten. Before she is\nmarried off. In fact it's the reason that she's married off so early. To keep her out of trouble.\nShe didn't need to be raped to protest. Some of us don't.</p>\n<p>She had heard from her mother, the story of how her father's brusher Biharilal and his son\nMaiyadeen falsified the land records and drove her father and musher out of the family house,\nforcing them to live in a little hut on the outskirts of the village.</p>\n<p>The angry little girl accompanied by a frightened older sister marches into her uncle's hora\nfield where the two of them hang around with a combative air, munching hora nuts and plucking\nflowers (combatively). Their cousin Maiyadeen, a young man in his twenties, orders the children\noff his premises. Phoolan refuses to move. Instead this remarkable child taunts him, and\nquestions his claim to the land. She was special.</p>\n<p>She is beaten unconscious with a brick.</p>\n<p>Phoolan Devi's first war, like almost every dacoit's first war, was fought for territory. It was\nthe classic beginning of the journey into dacoitdom.</p>\n<p>But does it have rape in it?</p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>Caste-violence?</p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>So is it worth including in the film?</p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>According to the book, her second protest too, has to do with territory. And it is this (not the\nsexual harassment bv the village louts, though that happens too), that lands Phoolan Devi in jail\nand enters her name in the police records.</p>\n<p>Maiyadeen, the book says, was enraged because the property dispute (thanks to Phoolan's\npleas to the village panchayat) had been re-opened and transferred to the Allahabad High\nCourt. As revenge he destroys Devideen's (Phoolan's father) crop, and is in the process of hacking\ndown their Neem tree when Phoolan intervenes and throws a stone at him. She is attacked,\ntrussed up, and handed to the police.</p>\n<p>Soon after she's released on bail, she is kidnapped by dacoits. This too, according to\nPhoolan's version ( upto, this point, there is no other version), is engineered by Maiyadeen as a\nruse to get her out of his hair.</p>\n<p>Maiyadeen does not figure in the film.</p>\n<p>Already some pretty big decisions have been made. What stays, what goes. What is high-lighted, what isn't.</p>\n<p>Life is Rape. The rest is jus' details.</p>\n<p>We then see Phoolan in the ravines, being repeatedly raped by Babu Singh Gujar, the\nThakur leader of the gang she has been kidnapped by. Vikram Mallah, the second-in-command\nis disgusted by his behaviour and puts a bullet through him. According to the book the killing\nhappens as a drunken Babu Gujar is threatening to assault Phoolan. In the film he's actually at\nit, lying on top of her, his naked bottoms jerking. As he breathes his last, Phoolan blinks the\nblood out of her eyes and looks long into the eyes of her redeemer. Just so that we get the\npoint. After this we are treated to a sequence of After-rape-romance. The touching bits about the\nfirst stirrings of sexual desire in a much-raped woman. The way it works in the film is If-you-\ntouch-me-I'll-slap-you-but-I-really-do-want-to-touch-you.</p>\n<p>It's choreographed like a dusty dance in which they rub against each other, but whenever he\ntouches her she swats his hand away, but nevertheless quivers with desire. It is such a crude,\nobvious, doltish depiction of conflict in a woman who is attracted to a man, but associates sex\nwith humiliation. It's not in the book, so I'm not sure whose version Shekhar has used. From the\nlooks of it, probably Donald Duck's.</p>\n<p>Vikram Mallah and Phoolan Devi become lovers. While the book and the film agree that he\nwas her one true love, the book does not suggest that he was her only lover.</p>\n<p>The film does. She has to be portrayed as a One Man Woman. Otherwise who's going to\npity her? So it's virtue or bust. One lover (a distant cousin) is eliminated completely. The other\n(Man Singh), is portrayed as what used to be known in college as a Rakhi-brother.\nFrom all accounts, Vikram Mallah seems to have been the midwife of Phoolan's birth into\ndacoitdom.</p>\n<p>He supervises her first act of retribution against her husband Puttilal.</p>\n<p>The film shows him bound and gagged, being beaten by Phoolan Devi with the butt of her\ngun, whimpering and crying with remembered rage.</p>\n<p>At having been raped. In the Retribution bits, she is allowed a little latitude. Otherwise, (as\nwe shall see) none at all.</p>\n<p>But there's a sly omission here. According to the book, according to Phoolan Devi herself,\nthere were two victims that day. Not one.</p>\n<p>The second one was a woman. Vidya, Puttilal's second wife.</p>\n<p>The film hasn't told us about a second experience Phoolan has with Puttilal. The time that\nMaiyadeen forced her to return to Puttilal. Phoolan arrived at her husband's house to find that\nhe had taken a second wife. Vidya harassed and humiliated Phoolan and eventually forced\nPuttilal to send her away.</p>\n<p>Her humiliation at Vidya's hands is more recent in Phoolan's memory.</p>\n<p>Phoolan, in her written version says she wanted to kill them both and leave a note saying\nthat this will be the fate of any man who takes two wives. Later she changed her mind and\ndecided to leave them alive to tell the tale. She beat them both. And broke Puttilal's hands and\nlegs. But what nice woman would do that?</p>\n<p>Beat up another woman?</p>\n<p>How would you feel sorry for someone like that?</p>\n<p>So, in the film, Vidya is dumped.</p>\n<p>Phoolan's affair with Vikram Mallah ends tragically when he is shot.</p>\n<p>She is captured bv his Thakur killers, gagged, bound, and transported to Behmai. The stage\nis set for what has come to be referred to as the \"centerpiece\" of the film. The gang-rape.\nIt is the scene by which the film is judged.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Phoolan herself is reticent about what happened. All she says is un logo ne\nmejhse bahut mazaak ki.</p>\n<p>She mentions being beaten, humliliated and paraded from village to village. She mentions\nanother woman dacoit Kusuma -- who disliked her, and taunted and abused her. (Of course\nthere's no sign of her in the film. It would only serve to confuse the Woman-as-victim moral\narithmetic.)</p>\n<p>Since Phoolan isn't forthcoming, it is the vivid (vicarious) account in Esquire by an American,\njournalist, Jon Bradshaw that has been enlisted to structure this scene.</p>\n<p>\"... Phoolan screamed, striking out at him, but he was too strong. Holding her down, the\nstranger raped her. They came in one by one after that. Tall, silent Thakur men -- and raped her\nuntil Phoolan lost consciousness. For the next three weeks Phoolan was raped several times a\nnight, and she submitted silently turning her face to the wall... she lost all sense of time... a loud\nvoice summoned her outside. Sri Ram ordered Phoolan to fetch water from the well. When she\nrefused, he ripped off her clothes and kicked her savagely...at last she limped to the well while\nher tormentors laughed and spat at her. The naked girl was dragged back to the hut and raped\nagain.\" Whatever Shekhar Kapur's other failings are, never let it be said that he wasn't a trier. He\ndid his bit too. He (Pioneer Aug 14th, India Today August 21st [1994])locked himself up in a\nroom - the door opening and closing as one man after another strode in - imagining himself\nbeing sodomized!!! After this feat of inter-sexual empathy, he arrives at some radical, definitive\nconclusions. \" There is no pain in a gang-rape, no physical pain after a while,\" he assures us \"It\nis about something as dirty as the abject humiliation of a human being and the complete\ndomination of its soul.\"</p>\n<p>Thanks baby. I would never have guessed.</p>\n<p>It's hard to match the self-righteousness of a film-maker with a cause. Harder when the film-\nmaker is a man and the cause is rape.</p>\n<p>And when it's the gang-rape of a low-caste woman by high-caste men .. don't even try it. Go\nwith the feeling.</p>\n<p>We see a lot of Phoolan's face, in tight close-up, contorted into a grimace of fear and pain as\nshe is raped and mauled and buggered. The overwhelming consensus in the press has been\nthat the rape was brilliantly staged and chilling.</p>\n<p>That it wasn't exploitative.</p>\n<p>Now what does that mean? Should we be grateful to Shekhar Kapur for not showing us the\ncondition of her breasts and genitals? Or theirs? That he leaves so much to our imagination?\nThat he gave us a tasteful rape?</p>\n<p>But I thought the whole point of this wonderful film was its no-holds-barred brutality? So why\nstop now? Why the sudden coyness?</p>\n<p>I'll tell you why. Because it's all about regulating the Rape-meter. Adjusting it enough to\nmake us a little preen-at-the-gills. Skip dinner perhaps . But not miss work.</p>\n<p>It's us, We-the-Audience, stuck in our voyeuristic middle-class lives who really make the\ndecisions about how much or how little rape/violence we can take/will applaud, and therefore,\nare given.</p>\n<p>It isn't about the story. (There are ways and ways of telling a story) It isn't about the Truth.\n(There are ways around that too. Right?) It isn't about what Really Happened. It's none of that\nhigh falutin' stuff.</p>\n<p>It's good old Us. We make the decisions about how much we would like to see. And when\nthe mixture's right, it thrills us,. And we purr with approbation.</p>\n<p>It's a class thing. If the controls are turned up too high, the hordes will get excited and arrive.\nTo watch the centrepiece. They might even whistle. They won't bother to cloak their eagerness\nin concern like we do.</p>\n<p>This way, it's fine, It's just Us and our Imagination.</p>\n<p>But hey, I have news for you - the hordes have heard and are on their way. They'll even pay\nto watch. It'll make money, the centrepiece. It's hot stuff</p>\n<p>How does one grade film-rapes on a scale from Exploitative to Non-exploitative?\nDoes it depend on how much skin we see? Or is it a more complex formula that juggles\nexposed skin, genitalia, and bare breasts?</p>\n<p>Exploitative I'd say, is when the whole point of the exercise is to stand on high moral ground,\nand inform us, (as if we didn't know), that rape is about abject humiliation.\nAnd, as in the case of this film, when it exploits exploitation. Phoolan has said (Pioneer,\nAugust 15 [1994]) that she thinks they're no better shall the men who raped her. This\nproducer/director duo.</p>\n<p>And they've done it without dirtying their hands. What was that again? The complete\ndomination of the soul? I guess you don't need hands to hold souls down.\nAfter the centrepiece, the film rushes through to its conclusion.</p>\n<p>Phoolan manages to escape from her captors and arrives at a cousin's house, where she\nrecuperates and then eventually teams up with Man Singh who later becomes her lover, (though\nof course the film won't admit it).</p>\n<p>On one foray into a village with her new gang, (one of the only times we see her indulging in\nsome non-rape-related banditry), we see her wandering through a village in a daze, with flaring\nnostrils, while the men loot and plunder. She isn't even scared when the police arrive. Before\nshe leaves she smashes a glass case, picks out a pair of silver anklets and gives it to a little girl.\nSweet.</p>\n<p>When Phoolan and her gang, arrive in Behmai for the denouement, everybody flees indoors\nexcept for a baby that is for some reason, left by the well, The gang fans out and gathers the\nThakurs who have been marked for death. Suddenly the colour seeps out of the film and\neverything becomes bleached and dream sequency. It all turns very conceptual. No brutal\nclose-ups. No bestiality.</p>\n<p>A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.</p>\n<p>The twenty-two men are shot The baby wallows around in rivers of blood. Then colour\nleaches back into the film.</p>\n<p>And with that, according to the film, she's more or less through with her business. The film\ncertainly, is more or less through with her. Because there's no more rape. No more retribution.\nAccording to the book, it is really only after the Behmai massacre that Phoolan Devi grows\nto fit her legend. There's a price on her head, people are baying for her blood, the gang\nsplinters. Many of them are shot by the police. Ministers and Chief-ministers are in a flap. The\npolice are in a panic . Dacoits are being shot down in fake encounters and their bodies are\npublicly displayed like game. Phoolan is hunted like an animal. But ironically, it is now, for the\nfirst time that she is in control of her life. She becomes a leader of men. Man Singh becomes\nher lover, but on her terms. She makes decisions. She confounds the police. She evades every\ntrap they set for her./ She plays daring little games with them. She undermines the credibility of\nthe entire UP police force. And all this time, the police don't even know what she really looks\nlike. Even when the famous Malkhan Singh surrenders, Phoolan doesn't.</p>\n<p>This goes on for two whole years. When she finally does decide to surrender, it is after\nseveral meetings with a persuasive policeman called Rajendra Chaturvedi, the SP of Bhind,\nwith whom she negotiates the terms of her surrender to the government of Madhya Pradesh.\nIs the film interested in any of this?</p>\n<p>Go on. Take a wild guess.</p>\n<p>In the film, we see her and Man Singh on the run, tired, starved and out of bullets. Man\nSingh seems concerned, practical and stoical.</p>\n<p>Phoolan is crying and asking for her mother!!!</p>\n<p>The next thing we know is that we're at surrender. As she gives up her gun, she looks at\nMan Singh and he gives her an approving nod.</p>\n<p>Good Girl! Clever girl!</p>\n<p>God Clever Girl</p>\n<p>Phoolan Devi spent three-and-a-half years in the ravines. She was wanted on 48 counts of\nmajor crime, 22 murder, the rest kidnaps-for-ransom and looting.</p>\n<p>Even simple mathematics tells me that we've been told just half the story.</p>\n<p>But the cool word for Half-truth is Greater-truth.</p>\n<p>Other signs of circular logic are beginning to surface.</p>\n<p>Such as: Life is Art</p>\n<p>Art is not Real</p>\n<p>How about changing the title of the film to: Phoolan Devi's Rape and Abject Humiliation:\nThe True half-Truth?</p>\n<p>How about sending it off to an underwater film festival with only one entry?</p>\n<p>What responsibility does a biographer have to his subject? Particularly to a living subject?</p>\n<p>None at all?</p>\n<p>Does it not matter what she thinks or how this is going to affect her life?</p>\n<p>Is he not even bound to shovv her the work before it is released for public consumption?</p>\n<p>If the issues involved are culpable criminal offenses such as Murder and Rape - if some of\nthem are still pending in a court of law -- legally, is he allowed to present conjecture, reasonable\nassumption and hearsay as the unalloyed \"Truth?\"</p>\n<p>Shekhar Kapur has made an appeal to the Censor Board to allow the film through without a single cut. He has said that the Film, as a work of Art, is a whole, if it were censored it wouldn't\nbe the same film.</p>\n<p>What about the Life that he has fashioned his Art from?</p>\n<p>He has a completelv different set of rules for that.</p>\n<p>It's been several months since the film premiered at Cannes. Several weeks since the\nshowings in Bombay and Delhi. Thousands of people have seen the film. It's being invited to\nfestivals all over the world.</p>\n<p>Phoolan Devi hasn't seen the film. She wasn't invited.</p>\n<p>I met her yesterday. In the morning papers Bobby Bedi had dismissed Phoolan's statements to the press -- \" Let Phoolan sit with me and point out inaccuracies in the film, I will\ncounter her accusations effectively, \" (Sunday Observer, August 21st [1994]). What is he going\nto do? Explain to her how it really happened?</p>\n<p>But it's deeper than that. His story to the press is one thing. To Phoolan it's quite another.\nIn front of me she rang him up and asked him when she could see the film. He would not give\nher a definite date.</p>\n<p>What's going on?</p>\n<p>Private screenings have been organised for powerful people. But not for her.\nThey hadn't bargained for this. She was supposed to be safely in jail. She wasn't\nsupposed to matter. She isn't supposed to have an opinion.</p>\n<p>\"Right now\", the Sunday Observer says, \"Bobby Bedi is more concerned about the Indian\nCensor Board than a grumbling Phoolan Devi.\"</p>\n<p>Legally, as things stand, in UP the charges against her haven't been dropped. (Mulayam\nSingh has tried, but an appeal against this is pending in the High Court).</p>\n<p>There are several versions of what happened at Behmai. Phoolan denies that she was\nthere. More importantly, two of the men who were shot at but didn't die say she wasn't there.\nOther eye- witnesses say she was. Nothing has been proved. Everything is conjecture.</p>\n<p>By not showing her the film, but keeping her quiet until it's too late to protest (until it has\nbeen passed by the Censors and the show hits the road), what are they doing to Phoolan? By\nappearing to remain silent, is she concurring with the film version of the massacre at Behmai?\nWhich states, unequivocally, that Phoolan was there. Will it appear as though she is admitting\nevidence against herself? Does she know that whether or not the film tells the Truth it is only a\nmatter of time before it becomes the Truth. And that public sympathy for being shown as a\nrape-victim doesn't get you off the hook for murder?</p>\n<p>Are they helping her to put her head in a noose?</p>\n<p>On the one hand the concerned cowboys Messrs Bedi &#x26; Kapur are so eager to share with\nus the abject humiliation and the domination of Phoolan Devi's \"soul\", and o n the other they\nseem to be so totally uninterested in her.</p>\n<p>In what she thinks of the film, or what their film will do to her life and future.\nWhat is she to them? A concept? Or just a cunt?</p>\n<p>One last terrifying thing. While she was still in jail, Phoolan was rushed to hospital\nbleeding heavily because of an ovarian cyst. Her womb was removed.
